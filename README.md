Jogurt Math Toolkit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mkacz91/math.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mkacz91/math)
===================

There is probably no other area in numeric algorithm programming that is so opinionated as the
structure of the primitive math toolkit. It gets implemented over and over again by multitude of
developers because any standarization cannot possibly succeed. Here I am with my take on that.

The toolkit is meant to contain:

  * essential elementary functions,
  * linear algebra primitives,
  * geometry primitives.

I am building this to suit my own needs and do not intend to please anyone whatsoever. But everyone
is free to use and adapt this work without restrictions.
